Compute morton keys blazingly fast using a look-up table.
The look-up table is automatically generated at compile-time thanks to template metaprogramming.

Thanks to Jeroen Baert for initial inspiration and his great blog post explaining morton keys (http://www.forceflow.be/2013/10/07/morton-encodingdecoding-through-bit-interleaving-implementations/)
